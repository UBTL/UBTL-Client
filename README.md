# UBTL-Client
The client for UBTL-Server

This is a fork of [LunaTranslator](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator) pre-configured to work with the UBTL-Server translator client.

For those that bought the client server and may need some help you can drop by my [Discord Server](https://discord.nexus34.xyz/)
Or message me through my [Patreon](https://donate.nexus34.xyz/) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/unclebanetl) whatever place you paid for it.
Im quite active/reachable on my Discord though so you have better luck over there.
